# arduino-send-temperature-sms-siemens-tc35
Code for Arduino to monitor temperature and to send it via SMS using Siemens TC35 GSM module  
My project is based on Arduino UNO controller that measuresï»¿ 
temperature via LM35 temperature sensor and then sends temperature via SMS using Siemens TC35 module. 
Only one disadvanatge of using Siemens TC35 module is that it requires to pust "power" button on it to be ready to send SMS messages. 
If you will be doing any production system think of how you will be "pushing" this button automatically or use another module.
